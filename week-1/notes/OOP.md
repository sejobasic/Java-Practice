- First OOP language was Simula 76 - was meant to simulate the real world

- Java uses a class-based system of OOP, where you create classes to represent
the various types of objects available in your application.

- Objects represent real things in your real world problem
- In order to create an Object you have to define a Class
- When creating a Class you are creating the ability to create Objects of that type

Four Pillars of OOP
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism

ABSTRACTION
  - You Only expose the operations you want to allow others to use

ENCAPSULATION
  - Keep data private so you control how its modified
  - Encapsulate things that we don't want exposed with private method
  - Encapsulate things that we want to expose with public method
